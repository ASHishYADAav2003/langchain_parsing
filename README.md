# LangChain Interview Preparation (100 Questions & Answers)

## Part 1: Basics of LangChain (1-10)

**1. What is LangChain?**
LangChain is an open-source orchestration framework for developing applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides standard interfaces for chains, agents, memory, and document retrieval.

**2. Why use LangChain over calling LLM APIs directly?**
LangChain abstracts away the boilerplate of API calls and provides composable building blocks (like prompt templates, memory, and document loaders) making it easier to build complex, multi-step LLM applications like RAG or Agents.

**3. What are the core components of LangChain?**
The core components are Models (LLMs/Chat Models), Prompts (PromptTemplates), Indexes (Document Loaders, Text Splitters, VectorStores, Retrievers), Chains, Memory, and Agents.

**4. What is the difference between an LLM and a Chat Model in LangChain?**
`LLMs` take a single string as input and return a string. `Chat Models` take a list of conversational messages (System, Human, AI) as input and return an AI message.

**5. How does LangChain handle prompts?**
LangChain uses `PromptTemplate` and `ChatPromptTemplate` to dynamically inject variables into static prompt strings before sending them to the LLM.

**6. What is the purpose of `PromptTemplate` in LangChain?**
It allows developers to create reusable, parameterized prompts, making it easy to swap out dynamic data (like user inputs or context) without rewriting the entire prompt.

**7. Can LangChain be used with models other than OpenAI?**
Yes, LangChain is model-agnostic. It supports integrations with Hugging Face, Anthropic, Google Gemini, NVIDIA NIM, Cohere, local models via Ollama, and more.

**8. What is the difference between LangChain and LangGraph?**
LangChain is the foundational framework for creating sequential or linear chains. LangGraph is a library built on top of LangChain designed for creating stateful, multi-actor, cyclic applications (like complex AI agents).

**9. Explain the role of memory in LangChain.**
By default, LLMs are stateless. Memory in LangChain allows chains and agents to remember previous interactions in a session, enabling conversational context.

**10. What are callbacks in LangChain used for?**
Callbacks are used to hook into the various stages of an LLM application (e.g., when a chain starts, an LLM generates a token, or an error occurs). They are crucial for logging, monitoring, and streaming output.

## Part 2: Chains & Types of Chains (11-20)

**11. What is a "Chain" in LangChain?**
A Chain is a sequence of calls to LLMs, tools, or data preprocessing steps, wrapped into a single coherent workflow.

**12. What is the `LLMChain`?**
The most basic chain in legacy LangChain, which combines a PromptTemplate with an LLM (and optionally an output parser).

**13. Describe the `SimpleSequentialChain`.**
It connects multiple chains in a linear sequence, where the singular output of one chain is passed directly as the singular input to the next chain.

**14. How does a `SequentialChain` differ from a `SimpleSequentialChain`?**
A `SequentialChain` handles multiple inputs and multiple outputs, allowing more complex routing of variables between different steps in the chain, unlike the single-input/output `SimpleSequentialChain`.

**15. What is a `TransformChain`?**
A chain that applies a custom Python function to modify or transform the input data before passing it down the pipeline.

**16. Explain the `RouterChain` and when you would use it.**
A `RouterChain` dynamically routes an input to one of several destination chains based on the content of the input (e.g., routing a math question to a math chain and a history question to a history chain).

**17. What is a Map-Reduce Chain?**
It splits a large document into smaller chunks, runs an initial prompt on each chunk (Map step), and then combines those individual results into a final cohesive output (Reduce step).

**18. What is the Refine Chain?**
It processes chunks of a document sequentially. It takes the first chunk, generates an initial answer, and then passes that answer along with the next chunk to the LLM to "refine" the answer iteratively.

**19. How does the Map-Rerank Chain work?**
It runs a prompt on each chunk of a document, asking the LLM not just for an answer but also for a confidence score. It then returns the answer with the highest score.

**20. What is a Stuff Documents Chain?**
The simplest document chain. It takes a list of documents, formats them all into a single prompt ("stuffing" them into the context window), and passes it to the LLM.

## Part 3: LCEL & Runnables (21-30)

**21. What is LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)?**
LCEL is a declarative way to easily compose chains together. It provides streaming, batching, and async support out of the box.

**22. What is a Runnable in LangChain?**
A Runnable is the standard interface in LCEL. Any object that implements `.invoke()`, `.batch()`, `.stream()`, and their async counterparts is a Runnable.

**23. How does the pipe (`|`) operator work in LCEL?**
The pipe operator connects Runnables together, passing the output of the left Runnable as the input to the right Runnable (e.g., `prompt | model | parser`).

**24. What is `RunnablePassthrough`?**
It allows passing inputs through unchanged or adding additional keys to a dictionary input without modifying the existing ones.

**25. Explain the purpose of `RunnableParallel`.**
Also known as a `RunnableMap`, it allows executing multiple Runnables concurrently on the same input and returning their outputs as a dictionary.

**26. How do you invoke a Runnable?**
By calling the `.invoke(input_data)` method on the instantiated LCEL chain.

**27. What is the difference between `invoke`, `batch`, and `stream` in LCEL?**
`invoke` processes a single input. `batch` processes a list of inputs in parallel. `stream` yields output chunks incrementally as they are generated by the LLM.

**28. How can you bind arguments to a Runnable?**
You can use the `.bind()` method to attach fixed arguments (like `stop` words or specific model kwargs) to a Runnable model.

**29. What is `RunnableLambda`?**
It converts any arbitrary Python function into a Runnable, allowing custom logic to be integrated seamlessly into an LCEL pipeline.

**30. Why is LCEL preferred over traditional Chain classes?**
LCEL provides better transparency, simpler syntax, automatic parallelization, out-of-the-box streaming, and easier debugging compared to legacy Chain classes like `LLMChain`.

## Part 4: Document Loaders (31-40)

**31. What is a Document Loader in LangChain?**
A class designed to extract data from a specific source (files, web, APIs) and convert it into a standard LangChain `Document` format.

**32. How do you load a text file using LangChain?**
By using the `TextLoader(file_path)` class and calling its `.load()` method.

**33. Can LangChain load data from web pages?**
Yes, using loaders like `WebBaseLoader`, `UnstructuredURLLoader`, or `SeleniumURLLoader`.

**34. Name three types of document loaders provided by LangChain.**
`PyPDFLoader` (PDFs), `CSVLoader` (CSV files), and `NotionDirectoryLoader` (Notion exports).

**35. How does the `PyPDFLoader` work?**
It parses a PDF file and loads each page of the PDF as a separate LangChain `Document` object, capturing the page number in the metadata.

**36. What is the standard structure of a Document object in LangChain?**
A Document has two main properties: `page_content` (a string containing the text) and `metadata` (a dictionary containing information about the data source).

**37. How can you load data from a database (like SQL) into LangChain?**
You can use tools like `SQLDatabaseLoader` or query the database directly using `SQLDatabase` utilities to extract records and map them to Document objects.

**38. What is the role of `metadata` in a Document?**
Metadata stores contextual information (e.g., author, date, source URL, page number) that is crucial for filtering during retrieval and tracking the origin of the information.

**39. Can document loaders extract metadata automatically?**
Yes, most specific loaders (like `YoutubeLoader` or `PyPDFLoader`) automatically extract and attach relevant metadata during the loading process.

**40. How does a YouTube transcript loader work?**
The `YoutubeLoader` takes a video URL, connects to the YouTube API (or uses scraping libraries), extracts the closed captions, and returns them as document text along with video metadata.

## Part 5: Output Parsers (41-50)

**41. What is an Output Parser in LangChain?**
A component that instructs the LLM on how to format its output and then parses that raw text output into a structured data format (like JSON, a Python list, or a Pydantic object).

**42. Why are Output Parsers necessary?**
LLMs natively output plain text strings. For building robust software, we often need structured data to pass into other functions or APIs.

**43. What is the `PydanticOutputParser`?**
It parses LLM output into a strongly typed Pydantic schema, ensuring the output contains specific fields of specific data types.

**44. How does the `CommaSeparatedListOutputParser` work?**
It asks the LLM to output a comma-separated string and parses it into a standard Python list of strings.

**45. Explain the `StructuredOutputParser`.**
It allows developers to define a custom schema of expected fields and descriptions, which parses the LLM output into a JSON dictionary.

**46. What happens if an LLM's output fails to parse?**
An `OutputParserException` is raised. This must be caught and handled, either by retrying or returning a default value.

**47. What is a RetryOutputParser?**
A special parser that wraps another parser. If the original parsing fails, it sends the original prompt, the failed output, and the error back to the LLM to ask it to fix the formatting.

**48. How do you use the `JsonOutputParser`?**
You pass it into the LCEL chain (`| JsonOutputParser()`). It expects the LLM output to be valid JSON and converts it to a Python dictionary.

**49. Can output parsers modify the prompt automatically?**
Yes. Parsers have a `.get_format_instructions()` method which returns a string containing the formatting rules. This string is injected into the PromptTemplate.

**50. What is the difference between output parsers and function calling?**
Output parsers rely on prompt engineering to force structured text generation. Function calling (or tool calling) is a native feature of specific models (like GPT-4) where the model explicitly generates JSON bound to a schema provided via the API.

## Part 6: Embeddings (51-60)

**51. What are embeddings in the context of LangChain?**
Embeddings are numerical vector representations of text. They map text into a high-dimensional mathematical space where words or sentences with similar meanings are located close together.

**52. Why do we need embeddings for text?**
Because computers understand numbers, not text. Embeddings allow us to mathematically calculate the similarity between a user's query and a set of documents.

**53. Does LangChain provide its own embedding models?**
No, LangChain provides wrapper classes (`Embeddings`) to connect with external embedding providers like OpenAI, HuggingFace, and Cohere.

**54. How do you use OpenAI embeddings in LangChain?**
By instantiating the `OpenAIEmbeddings` class and passing it your API key, then calling methods to embed your text.

**55. What is the difference between `embed_query` and `embed_documents`?**
`embed_query` is used to embed a single search query string. `embed_documents` is used to embed a batch of document texts that will be stored in a vector database.

**56. Can you use open-source embeddings (like HuggingFace) in LangChain?**
Yes, using the `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` class, which allows you to run models locally via the `sentence-transformers` library.

**57. What is the dimension of an embedding?**
It is the length of the vector array. For example, OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` produces vectors of 1,536 dimensions.

**58. How do embeddings capture semantic meaning?**
They are trained on massive datasets using neural networks to predict words based on context. Consequently, words used in similar contexts end up with similar vector representations.

**59. What happens if you change the embedding model after generating embeddings?**
You cannot mix embeddings from different models. If you change the model, you must re-embed all your documents from scratch because the vector spaces are completely different.

**60. What are contextualized vs. static embeddings?**
Static embeddings (like Word2Vec) assign the same vector to a word regardless of context. Contextualized embeddings (like OpenAI or BERT) assign different vectors based on the surrounding sentence (e.g., "bank" of a river vs. "bank" for money).

## Part 7: Vector Databases (61-70)

**61. What is a Vector Database?**
A specialized database designed to store, manage, and perform incredibly fast nearest-neighbor searches on high-dimensional vectors.

**62. Why are Vector Databases essential for LLM applications?**
They enable efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by allowing the system to instantly search millions of documents to find the context most relevant to a user's prompt.

**63. Name three popular Vector Databases supported by LangChain.**
Pinecone, Chroma, and Qdrant.

**64. How does LangChain integrate with a VectorStore?**
LangChain provides a universal `VectorStore` interface. You can initialize a specific store (like `Chroma`) and use standard methods like `add_documents` and `similarity_search`.

**65. What is the difference between Pinecone and Chroma?**
Pinecone is a managed, cloud-based vector database service. Chroma is primarily an open-source, lightweight vector database designed to run locally (though it has cloud options).

**66. How do you add documents to a LangChain VectorStore?**
By using the `VectorStore.from_documents(documents, embeddings)` class method, which automatically embeds the documents and stores them in the DB.

**67. What is FAISS and how is it used in LangChain?**
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search. LangChain provides a `FAISS` vector store wrapper for fast, in-memory local vector search.

**68. Can you use a traditional SQL database as a Vector Store?**
Yes, if it has vector extensions. For example, PostgreSQL can be used as a vector database using the `pgvector` extension.

**69. What is an in-memory vector store?**
A vector store that keeps all data in RAM rather than on disk (e.g., DocArrayInMemorySearch). It is extremely fast but all data is lost when the application shuts down.

**70. How do you persist (save) a local vector store like Chroma?**
By specifying a `persist_directory` during initialization. The vector database will save its state to that folder, allowing you to load it in future sessions without re-embedding.

## Part 8: Semantic Search (71-80)

**71. What is Semantic Search?**
A search technique that looks for the *meaning* or intent behind a query rather than just doing exact literal keyword matches.

**72. How is Semantic Search different from Keyword Search?**
Keyword search (lexical search like BM25) fails if synonyms are used (e.g., searching "car" won't match "automobile"). Semantic search uses embeddings to understand that "car" and "automobile" have the same meaning.

**73. What is Cosine Similarity?**
A mathematical metric used to measure how similar two vectors are, calculated by measuring the cosine of the angle between them. It is the most common metric for semantic search.

**74. How does Euclidean Distance relate to semantic search?**
It measures the straight-line distance between two vectors. While cosine similarity measures angle (direction), Euclidean measures pure distance. Both are used to find "nearest neighbors".

**75. What is `similarity_search` in LangChain?**
A standard VectorStore method that takes a string query, converts it to an embedding, and returns the top `k` most similar documents from the database.

**76. What is Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) in semantic search?**
MMR is an algorithm that attempts to maximize the relevance of search results to the query while simultaneously penalizing results that are too similar to each other.

**77. Why would you use MMR instead of standard similarity search?**
Standard similarity search might return 5 chunks from the exact same page because they are all highly relevant. MMR ensures diversity in the results, providing a broader context to the LLM.

**78. What is a Retriever in LangChain?**
An interface that wraps a VectorStore (or other data sources) and simply returns a list of Documents given a string query. It provides a `.invoke(query)` method.

**79. How does a MultiQueryRetriever work?**
It uses an LLM to generate multiple variations of the user's initial query, performs a vector search for each variation, and takes the unique union of all results to improve retrieval robustness.

**80. Explain the concept of metadata filtering in vector search.**
Metadata filtering allows you to restrict the vector search based on structured metadata (e.g., "only search documents where `author = 'John'`"). This is done before or during the vector similarity search.

## Part 9: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) & Types of RAG (81-90)

**81. What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?**
RAG is an architecture where an LLM's response is augmented by dynamically retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base before generating the final answer.

**82. Why is RAG useful for LLMs?**
It solves the problem of hallucination on unseen data, provides access to up-to-date or proprietary information, and allows the system to cite its sources.

**83. What are the key steps in a standard RAG pipeline?**
Load documents -> Split text into chunks -> Embed chunks -> Store in Vector DB -> Retrieve relevant chunks based on user query -> Pass query + chunks to LLM -> Generate answer.

**84. What is Naive RAG?**
The simplest RAG implementation: take the user query, do a simple vector search, stuff the top-k results into a prompt, and ask the LLM for an answer.

**85. What is Advanced RAG?**
Techniques that improve upon Naive RAG by adding steps like query transformation (rewriting), pre-retrieval routing, post-retrieval re-ranking, and context compression.

**86. Explain what Re-ranking is in RAG.**
After retrieving top-k documents (e.g., k=20) using fast vector search, a separate, more computationally expensive model (a cross-encoder) re-scores and re-orders the documents to find the absolute most relevant top-n (e.g., n=5) to send to the LLM.

**87. What is a Parent Document Retriever?**
A technique where you split documents into very small chunks for precise vector search, but when a chunk is matched, the retriever returns the larger "parent" document context to the LLM to preserve narrative flow.

**88. What is Self-RAG?**
A RAG methodology where the LLM is trained or prompted to self-reflect during the generation process. It decides *if* it needs to retrieve, generates an answer, critiques its own answer based on the retrieved context, and revises it.

**89. Describe Graph RAG (Graph-based RAG).**
Instead of just using vector similarity, Graph RAG extracts entities and relationships from text to build a Knowledge Graph. Retrieval involves traversing the graph to provide highly structured and relational context.

**90. What is the problem of "Lost in the Middle" in RAG and how to solve it?**
LLMs tend to pay more attention to information at the very beginning and very end of their context window, ignoring the middle. To solve it, RAG systems can use techniques like Re-ranking, Context Compression, or `LongContextReorder` to place the most relevant chunks at the edges.

## Part 10: Agents, Memory, and Tools (91-100)

**91. What is a LangChain Agent?**
An Agent is a system where an LLM is given access to a set of tools (functions) and uses its reasoning capabilities to decide *which* tools to use, *when* to use them, and *what* inputs to pass to them to accomplish a task.

**92. How does an Agent differ from a Chain?**
In a Chain, the sequence of operations is hard-coded in code. In an Agent, the LLM dynamically dictates the sequence of operations at runtime.

**93. What is ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) prompting?**
A framework for Agents where the prompt forces the LLM to alternate between thinking (Reasoning) about what to do next and generating a tool command (Acting) to observe the result.

**94. What is a Tool in LangChain?**
A Python function (like a web search, API call, or math calculator) wrapped in a specific LangChain interface with a name and a natural language description so the LLM understands how and when to use it.

**95. How do you give an Agent access to a custom function?**
You can use the `@tool` decorator on a standard Python function. The docstring of the function becomes the description the LLM reads to understand the tool.

**96. What is the `AgentExecutor`?**
The runtime environment that actually executes the Agent's plan. It takes the LLM's output, calls the requested tool, handles errors, and feeds the tool's output back to the Agent.

**97. Explain `ConversationBufferMemory`.**
The simplest memory type. It keeps a raw transcript of every human-AI message in a session and injects the entire transcript into the prompt.

**98. What is `ConversationSummaryMemory` and when to use it?**
Instead of storing raw text, it uses an LLM to continuously summarize the conversation history as it happens. Use it for long conversations to prevent blowing past the context window limit.

**99. How does an Agent handle multiple tools?**
The prompt provides the LLM with a list of available tools and their descriptions. When the user asks a question, the LLM analyzes the query and selects the tool that best fits the requirement.

**100. Can Agents interact with APIs and databases directly?**
Yes. You can provide an Agent with a tool that executes SQL queries (like SQLDatabaseToolkit) or a tool that makes REST API calls (like OpenAPI agents), allowing the AI to query databases or perform actions on external platforms.
